<h5 id="Definitions"><a href="#Definitions" class="headerlink" title="Definitions"></a>Definitions</h5><p>‚ÄúThe process or result of becoming cultured, knowledgeable, or disillusioned.‚Äù<br>-Merriam Webster (1)<br>‚ÄúThe process or result of becoming more complex, developed, or subtle‚Äù<br>-Merriam Webster (2)<br>‚ÄúHaving a good understanding of the way people behave and&#x2F;or a good knowledge of culture and fashion.‚Äù<br>-Cambridge University Press (1)<br>‚ÄúIntelligent or made in a complicated way and therefore able to do complicated tasks.‚Äù<br>-Cambridge University Press (2)</p>
<h4 id="Sophism"><a href="#Sophism" class="headerlink" title="Sophism"></a>Sophism</h4><p>Sophistication derives its meaning from the Sophists of Ancient Greece. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/intro_text/chapter%202%20greeks/sophists.htm">This Link</a> provides a disgusting mess of a webpage, but incredibly useful for figuring out what Sophists did. They lived in Ancient Greece, traveling around the Aegean Sea and teaching things people wanted to know, in exchange for moolah. No widely useful paper existed at the time, so Sophists provided a way to disseminate information amoung the masses, as well as settle disputes. ‚ÄúThe best spoken idea would win‚Ä¶‚Äù the webpage goes on to say. Calling the Sophists ‚Äúrespected, feared and hated.‚Äù My favorite section of the article is when it lists potential courses your typical Sophist might teach, such as ‚ÄúHow to win no matter how bad your case is,‚Äù an old favorite of mine, and ‚ÄúHow to win friends and influence people‚Äù which is fully just stolen from the title of a god awful self help book, ‚ÄúHow to succeed in business without really trying‚Äù an excellent 1967 musical comedy, and ‚ÄúHow to fall into a pigsty and come out smelling like a rose,‚Äù which was apparently common enough to warrant an entire class on it. My advice would be to wash. In any case, the Sophists seemed masters of obfuscation, particularly in ways that were advantageous to their perspective. Their career field has evolved into the world of politics, in which people use retoric to win arguments and make the other side feel bad about themselves and their place in the world.</p>
<h4 id="Mechanisms"><a href="#Mechanisms" class="headerlink" title="Mechanisms"></a>Mechanisms</h4><p>The multiple definitions of sophistication are an extremely useful lens through which to view the rapidly changing technological landscape. In current life we use a variety of mechanisms, from faucets that make a lot of noise when you turn them on, to garbage cans that make a lot of noise when you roll them to the end of the driveway. The average person living in the United States has little idea of the complexities of the mechanisms around them. Mechanisms are frequently proposed as systems that will make life simpler, but instead abstracts away complexity, making it much harder for a group to tell they‚Äôre being taken advantage of. The devil is literally in the details.</p>
<p>This concludes my feature presentation on why etymology can be useful in understanding the current world.</p>
