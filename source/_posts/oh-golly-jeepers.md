Aw man, the realization that people will read the things I write is a little disconcerting. Throughout my life, I've primarily written only for myself, building worlds and characters and things to play with when I get bored. Hopefull this blog will help people be more interesting and less bored. It would be great if people read these things. I have spoken.
